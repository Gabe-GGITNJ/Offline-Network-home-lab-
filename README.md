# Offline-Network-Home-Lab-
Offline Network used for testing Hardware and Software

## Overview
As I progressed with learning more about IT. I realized I needed a physical lab that I could work on to help myself understand new tech that was being released. 
And I also be able to help others learn at the same time.   The most important thing for this setup was I did not want an external connection to the Internet. 
I would be using a variety of machines within this lab environment and some that were no longer receiving security updates.   

It would be a diverse environment with different Windows OS's, this would be physical machines along with virtual, as well as a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- Some of the machines would connect via ethernet cable to a pre-configured Switch and others would connect via WiFi
- The lab would be portable in a sense that I could bring it with me to different locations as a presentation piece

## Equipment Used 
- ALFA Network Inc. AWUS036ACH

- Lenovo B575 (manually removed wifi card) Running Windows 10
- Virtual Copy of Windows 7

## Installation/Configuration

I decided to purchase a few quality pieces of hardware with going with Ubiquiti Items and the Alfa Network Adapter. 
Before setting up the home lab I was able to configure the items with an actual live network connection to get any firmware updates. 

The great thing about the Edgerouter X is that it can be configured for offline use with the AP AC Lite.  This was a great feature since I didn't have to worry about any external factors once the firmware was updated. 

The Alfa Networks Adapter was a little intimidating at first. I didn't realize at first that it's capable of long range use. I found this out after configuring for the B575 via the Alfa app and saw more networks that I anticiapated seeing. 

## Usage

Once the firmware updates were complete I was able to setup the Edgerouter X for offlince use.  I was able to complete this by using their setup instructions and tweking them a bit by setting the network settings myself.  The AC AP Lite also worked by allowing a few of the machines to connect via WiFi.
