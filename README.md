# Offline-Network-Home-Lab-
Offline Network used for testing Hardware and Software

## Overview
As I progressed with learning more about IT. I realized I needed a physical lab that I could work on to help myself understand new tech that was being released. 
And I also be able to help others learn at the same time.   The most important thing for this setup was I did not want an external connection to the Internet. 
I would be using a variety of machines within this lab environment and some that were no longer receiving security updates.   

It would be a diverse environment with different Windows OS's, this would be physical machines along with virtual, as well as a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- Some of the machines would connect via ethernet cable to a pre-configured Switch and others would connect via WiFi
- The lab would be portable in a sense that I could bring it with me to different locations as a presentation piece
